# Welcome to My GitHub ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hi! I'm a rising 10th-grade student at Troy High School with a strong interest in computer science, data analysis, and social impact through technology. I enjoy solving algorithmic problems, especially through the USACO platform, and working on research projects that combine science and technology.

I'm also the founder of InnoYouth, a youth-led initiative focused on supporting individuals in Korea suffering from rare ophthalmic genetic diseases. Our mission is to connect genetic data with clinical symptoms through an open, patient-driven platform to enable better understanding and research.

## Purpose of This Repository

This GitHub space serves as my learning and research portfolio. It includes:
- My USACO training log, organized by level (Bronze, Silver, etc.), including problem-solving notes and source code
- Research projects in computer science and genetics, with a focus on real-world impact
- My work with InnoYouth, including data collection, pedigree visualization tools, and DNA-disease matching processes using public databases like OMIM
- Occasional personal coding experiments and public interest tech initiatives

## How I Plan to Use GitHub

- To track my coding progress and algorithm skills over time
- To document and share my research journey, from data collection to visualization
- To collaborate with mentors and teammates, especially on the InnoYouth platform
- To practice using version control and software engineering tools as I prepare for more advanced projects in the future

Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
